In browser app: http://localhost:3000/home

This CRUD app was developed with the hospitality sector in mind, with the objective to make it easier for both 
managers and staff to have access to available rooms and their information, such as:

- Room Number
- Price of the room in Â£
- The name of the guest who is residing in the room
- The type of stay, if the guest is staying one more day or if the guest is staying only one night

As the project stands, the person visiting the website can add, change and delete reservations from a mongoDB Atlas database
